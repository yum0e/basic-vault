# yearn vault

The aim of this contract is to offer a Rust implementation of the (Vault)[https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults/blob/main/contracts/Vault.vy] created by the team of yearn finance. The contract is written to suit to the Elrond Blockchain.

This vault is implemented in order to be created by a (Registry)[https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults/blob/main/contracts/Registry.vy] contract, just like the yearn team did in their workflow.

I do NOT recommend using this implementation in production as it was written for educational purposes.
